SonarEye is an innovative assistive device designed to support individuals with visual impairments by providing real-time distance feedback. Utilizing an ultrasonic sensor, SonarEye detects the proximity of obstacles in the user's path. The device activates a buzzer to alert the user as they approach an obstacle:

-At a distance of 150 cm, the buzzer emits a slow, rhythmic sound, indicating a safe range.
-As the user gets closer, the buzzer's frequency increases, becoming more rapid and intense when the distance falls below 50 cm, signaling potential danger.
In addition to the audible alerts, SonarEye features an LCD display that shows the real-time distance between the user and the nearest obstacle, giving additional visual feedback to assist with navigation.

This combination of auditory and visual feedback helps individuals with visual impairments navigate their surroundings with greater confidence, providing both warning and real-time data about their proximity to obstacles.
