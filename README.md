# SonarEye

// S o n a r  E y e // is an innovative assistive device designed to support individuals with visual impairments by providing real-time distance feedback. Utilizing an ultrasonic sensor, SonarEye detects the proximity of obstacles in the user's path. As the user approaches an obstacle, the device activates a buzzer to alert them.

--At a distance of 150 cm, the buzzer emits a slow, rhythmic sound, indicating a safe range.
--As the user gets closer, the buzzer's frequency increases, becoming more rapid and intense when the distance falls below 50 cm, signaling potential danger.

This simple yet effective technology enables greater independence for individuals with visual impairments by alerting them to obstacles in their environment.

This version emphasizes the device's functionality, the progressive change in buzzer sound, and its primary benefit of aiding individuals with visual impairments.
